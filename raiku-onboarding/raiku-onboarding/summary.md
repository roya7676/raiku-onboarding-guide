# Raiku Onboarding Summary

I joined the Raiku Discord with excitement to learn the onboarding process.  
First, I verified my GitHub account and created a public repository named `raiku-onboarding-guide`.  
Inside the repo, I added files like `README.md` and `steps.md` to document the actual steps I followed.  
I tried linking GitHub to Discord multiple times and received the "No Tier Assigned" message.  
To make my activity more authentic, I created `summary.md` to fully document my journey.  
I hope this shows that I genuinely participated, learned, and contributed to the Raiku onboarding experience.
